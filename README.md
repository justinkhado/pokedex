The Pokedex app is an encyclopedia of Pokemon (up to Generation VII) that offers searching and filtering for convenient lookup. Each Pokemon features 
information about their basic attributes, abilities, evolutions, stats, type weaknesses, and movesets.
<br /><br />
This application is supported by [another repo](https://github.com/justinkhado/pokedex-data) which features curated data and assets from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
